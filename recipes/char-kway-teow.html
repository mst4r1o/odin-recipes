        <h2>Description</h2>

            While it may look to be very straightforward and just a stir fried noodle dish, there are many different layers and variations to it, making it deceptively difficult! Even some top chefs are unable to grasp the skills it take to fry this heavenly piece of meal but with this simple recipe, I'm sure all of you will be able to at least get the gist of it.

            <li>Mix Sauce together</li>

            <li>Cook using base recipe or easier method</li>
            <li>Heat lard and 1tbsp oil in a wok or very large heavy based skillet over high heat. Swirl around the wok.</li>
            <li>When it starts smoking, add prawns. Cook for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add garlic, stir for 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add noodles, then using both hands on the handle, toss 4 times until coated with oil(or gently fold using a spatula + wooden spoon).</li>

            <li>Pour Sauce over noodles, then toss to disperse sauce through the noodles. Pause between tosses to give the noodles a chance to caramelise on the edges.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately!</li>
